<ul>
<li>You will work <b>individually</b> on this assignment. Read the
<a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-integrity-policy/programming-assignments">
DCS Academic Integrity Policy for Programming Assignments</a> - you are responsible
for this. In particular, note that <b>"All Violations of the Academic
Integrity Policy will be reported by the instructor to the appropriate Dean".</b>

</li><li><h3>IMPORTANT - READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY!!!</h3>

<b>We will only grade submissions in Autolab.</b>

<p>Assignments emailed to the instructor/TAs/graders will
be ignored--they will NOT be accepted for grading. Also, any assignment
on your computer, or any other online space, will NOT be accepted for grading,
even if it appears to be not modified after a submission date.<br>

</p><p><font color="red">If your program does not compile, you will not get any credit.</font> 

</p><p>Most compilation errors occur for two reasons: 
</p><ol>
  <li> You delete the "package" statement at the top of the file.
If you do this, you are changing the program structure, and it will not compile when we
test it. So make sure you understand how to work with packages.
</li><li> You make some last minute 
changes, and submit without compiling. 
</li></ol>

<h3>To avoid these issues, (a) START EARLY, and
give yourself plenty of time to work through the assignment, and (b) Submit a version well
before the deadline so there is at least something in Autolab for us to grade. 
And you can keep submitting an unlimited number of versions - we will 
grade the LATEST version only.</h3>

<p><a name="background"></a></p><h3>Background</h3>
Read Section 3.1 in the textbook for background on polynomials and polynomial 
arithmetic.<p>

A polynomial may be represented using a linked list as follows:
for every term in the polynomial there is one entry in the 
linked list consisting of the term's coefficient and degree.
The entries are ordered according to ASCENDING values of degree, i.e. lowest degree
term first, then next lowest degree term and so on, all the way up to the highest degree
term. IMPORTANT: Zero-coefficient terms are NOT stored.</p><p>

For example, the following polynomial (the symbol '^' is used to 
mean 'raised to the power'):
</p><pre>      4x^5 - 2x^3 + 2x +3
</pre>
can be represented as the linked list of terms:
<pre>      (3,0) -&gt; (2,1) -&gt; (-2,3) -&gt; (4,5)
</pre>
where each term is a (coefficient,degree) pair.<p>

Notes about representation:
</p><ul>
<li> Terms are stored in ASCENDING order of degrees from front to 
rear in a non-circular linked list. 
</li><li> Zero-coefficient terms are NOT stored.
</li><li><font color="red">An EMPTY (zero) polynomial is represented by a linked list with NO 
NODES in it, i.e. referenced by NULL.</font>
</li><li>Coefficients are real numbers
</li><li>Degrees are POSITIVE integers,
except if there is a constant term, in which case the degree is zero.
</li><li>There will not be more than one term in the same degree. 
</li></ul>
<font color="red"><b>If you do not represent all your polynomials (the initial inputs
as well as those you get out of doing arithmetic on polynomials) as above, you
will lose credit even if your results are mathematically correct.</b></font>

<p></p><hr>

<p><a name="impl"></a></p><h3>Implementation and Grading</h3>

<p>At the bottom of the Autolab assignment page, under <b>Handouts</b>,
  you will see a <tt>polynomial_project.zip</tt> file, which is an 
  Eclipse project file. Download it to your computer. DO NOT unzip it.

  </p><p>Instead, follow the instructions on the Eclipse page 
under the section "Importing a Zipped Project into Eclipse" to get the entire
project into your Eclipse workspace.

</p><p>You will see a project called <tt>Polynomial</tt> with 
the following classes in package <tt>poly</tt>:
</p><ul>
<li><tt>Node</tt>
</li><li><tt>Term</tt>
</li><li><tt>Polynomial</tt>
</li><li><tt>Polytest</tt>
</li></ul>

<p>(Aside from these, there are also three sample input files, described in
the <b>Running the Program</b> section below.)

</p><p>You need to complete the implementation of
the <tt>Polynomial</tt> class where indicated in the
following methods:

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Method</th><th>Grading Points</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>evaluate</tt></td><td class="pts">10</td></tr><tr>
</tr><tr><td><tt>add</tt></td><td class="pts">25</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>multiply</tt></td><td class="pts">25</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>You may use <tt>Math</tt> class methods as needed.

</p><p>There is no formal requirement of efficiency for any of the methods.
  However, every test case run will be timed out after 3 seconds, which is
  plenty of time even for inefficient code. If your method is timed
  out on a test case you will get no credit for that test.

</p><p><font color="red">Note: You will get a zero if you use any other
data structure (e.g. array/arraylist) <em>anywhere</em> in your implementation,
for <em>any</em> reason, even if it has nothing to do with the actual
polynomial operations.  You must work with linked lists ONLY all the
way through. </font>

</p><ul>
<li>Do not change <tt>Node</tt> and <tt>Term</tt> in any way. You will
not be submitting them, and we will be using the original versions to
test your <tt>Polynomial</tt> implementation.

</li><li>If you wish to change <tt>Polytest</tt>, feel free. You will not
be submitting it, and we will not be using it to grade your 
<tt>Polynomial</tt> submission.
</li></ul>

<p></p><p>Observe the following rules while working on <tt>Polynomial.java</tt>:

</p><ul>
<li>Only fill in the code in the methods 
<tt>add</tt>, <tt>multiply</tt>, and <tt>evaluate</tt> where indicated. 
</li><li> In methods that return a <tt>Polynomial</tt> (<tt>add</tt> and
<tt>multiply</tt>), the polynomial that is returned must be represented as
described in the "Notes about representation" part of the <b>Background</b> 
section above. <br>
<b>Your method will not get credit</b> if the returned
polynomial does not adhere to this representation, even it is
mathematically correct.<br>
Also see the "Notes about empty (zero) polynomials" at
the end of the <b>Running the program</b> section below.
</li><li><b>DO NOT</b> remove the <tt>package</tt>
line at the top of the file.
</li><li> <b>DO NOT</b> remove any of the <tt>import</tt> statements.
</li><li> <b>DO NOT</b> add any import statements.
</li><li> <b>DO NOT</b> change the headers of ANY of the given methods
</li><li> <b>DO NOT</b> change/remove any of the given class fields
</li><li> <b>DO NOT</b> add any new class fields - this includes variables
  and classes.
</li><li> <b>YOU MAY</b> add new helper methods, but you must 
declare them <b>private</b>.
</li></ul>
<p>Before you submit, make sure to check your code
against the original <tt>Polynomial.java</tt>, 
<tt>Term.java</tt>, and 
<tt>Node.java</tt> files to 
make sure you have adhered to the rules above.

</p><p></p><hr>

<p><a name="running"></a></p><h3>Running the program</h3>

There are three sample input files for you to test (they should be 
under the project folder in Eclipse): <br>
<ul>
<li> A file <tt>ptest1.txt</tt> that contains the polynomial
<pre>4x^5 - 2x^3 + 2x + 3</pre>
</li><li> A file <tt>ptest2.txt</tt> that contains the polynomial 
<pre>8x^4 + 4x^3 - 3x + 9</pre>
</li><li> A file <tt>ptest1opp.txt</tt> that contains the polynomial
<pre>-4x^5 + 2x^3 - 2x - 3</pre> (the negation of the polynomial in
<tt>ptest1</tt>)
</li></ul>

<p></p><p>In each of these files, each line is a term, with the first value being the
coefficient, and the second value being the degree. The terms are listed
in <b>descending</b> order of degrees and the respective non-zero coefficients.
Remember that when you store a polynomial in a linked list, you will
store it in <b>ascending</b> order of degrees. (This is actually 
already implemented by the Polynomial constructor when it reads a
polynomial from an input file. All you have to do is make sure you
stick with this rule when you add and multiply.)

</p><p>You may assume that we will NOT test with an invalid polynomial file, i.e.
every test input file will either have at least one
term in the correct format, or will be
empty (see <b>Notes about empty (zero) polynomials</b> below). So you
don't need to check for validity of input.

</p><p>Here's a sample run of the driver, <tt>Polytest</tt>. Apart from
 <tt>ptest1.txt</tt>, <tt>ptest2.txt</tt>, and <tt>ptest1opp.txt</tt>, 
a fourth test polynomial file, <tt>ptestnull.txt</tt> is
 also used. This is an empty file that stands for a null (zero)
 polynomial - you will need to create this yourself. 
See notes after the test run for special instructions
 regarding zero polynomials.

<p>The sample tests we have given you are
just for starters. You will need to create
other tests of your own on which you can run your code. For every test you
run, be careful to keep your test input in the same format as the test
files provided, otherwise <tt>Polytest</tt> will not work correctly. And make
sure your test file is in the same folder as the other files, i.e. under
<tt>Polynomial</tt>.

</p><p><font color="red">Note on translation from internal to output representation</font>:

</p><p>The <tt>toString</tt> method in the <tt>Polynomial</tt> class returns
a string with the terms in descending order, fit for printing. (It processes
the ascending ordered terms of the input linked list in reverse order.)
For illustration, see how the <tt>add</tt> method in 
<tt>Polytest</tt> prints the resulting polynomial:
</p><pre>    System.out.println("Sum: " + Polynomial.toString(Polynomial.add(poly1,poly2)) + "\n");
</pre>

<p></p><p><font color="red">Notes about empty (zero) polynomials</font>:
</p><ul>
<li>If you want to test with an empty polynomial input, you should
create a file with nothing in it. In Eclipse, you can do this by right
clicking on the project name in the package explorer view, then
selecting <b>New</b>,
then selecting <b>File</b>. Give a name, and click <b>Finish</b>. You
new file will show up under the project name folder in the package
explorer view, and the file will be opened in the text editor
view. But don't type anything in the file. 
</li><li>Remember that when you add two terms of the same degree, if you
get a zero coefficient result term, it should not be added to the
result polynomial. As listed in the "Notes about representation" in
the <b>Background</b> section, zero-coefficient terms are not stored.
</li><li>The string representation of a zero polynomial is "0" - see the <tt>toString</tt>
method of the <tt>Polynomial</tt> class. So, the <tt>Polytest</tt>
driver will print a zero for a zero polyomial input, or a zero
polynomial that results from an operation performed on two polynomials.
</li></ul>

<p></p><hr>

<p><a name="submission"></a></p><h3>Submission</h3>

<p>Submit your <b>Polynomial.java</b> source file in Autolab.

</p><p>If you are using Eclipse, refer to the instructions in the <b>Eclipse</b> 
page, under the section <b>The Eclipse Workspace</b> to know how to locate 
<b>Polynomial.java</b> on your computer for uploading.

</p><p></p><hr>

<p><a name="grading"></a></p><h3>Grading Process</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
  Your code will be auto-graded by a grading program (grader),
that will
run several test cases on each of <tt>evaluate</tt>, <tt>add</tt>,
  and <tt>multiply</tt>.
  <p>  </p></li><li>The grader will NOT be run every time you submit - it will only be
      run twice, see the following.
  <p></p></li><li>The grader will be run once 48 hours before the regular deadline,
      so Feb 17 at 11PM, on your latest submission as of that time.
The grader will report whether your submission compiled, and if so, 
      what score you got on the test cases that were run on your submission.
      The test cases themselves will not be revealed at this time.



<p></p></li><li>The grader will be run for the second (and last) time after all
  late submission deadlines have passed, i.e. after Feb 21, 11 PM,
  on your latest submission as of that time. So if you submitted
  something before the regular deadline, but submitted again afterward,
  during the late submission period, your last submission in the late
  period will be graded, and you will be assessed a penalty for lateness
  (10 points per day).

    <p></p></li><li>We will not accept requests to grade any other submission other than the latest submission found by Autolab.
	
    <p></p></li><li>For each test case, the result
computed by your code will be compared with that computed by our
correct code. Each test case is a unit of partial credit, so credits
for a method are accumulated one test case at a time. There is no
partial credit within a test case: either your program works 
on a test case (full credit for that test case), or it doesn't (no
credit for that test case.)

<p>Note that for the <tt>add</tt> and <tt>multiply</tt>
multiply methods, the auto-grader will examine the resulting
linked list, NOT printed output. (The auto-grader does NOT use
<tt>Polytest</tt> at all - that is just for your use.)  In other
words, the grading script will compare the linked list structure of
the correct result with the linked list structure in your
implementation. For <tt>evaluate</tt>, the returned float value
will be checked.

</p><p>If you call the <tt>add</tt> method in your <tt>multiply</tt>
implementation, be aware that if your <tt>add</tt> implementation does
not work correctly, your <tt>multiply</tt> method's correctness will
be adversely impacted as well, and you will lose credit for it as
well for the failed test cases.

</p><p></p></li><li>All printed output will be ignored. This also
means if you threw in print statements for debugging and left them in
your code, they will have no bearing on the grading.

    <p>After the second and final grading run,
      the test cases used by the grader will be posted so you can run your
program against them to verify the grade report.
Remember, verification means checking the <b>in-memory contents</b> of the
linked list for <tt>add</tt> and <tt>multiply</tt>, and the
return value of <tt>evaluate</tt> -- NOT what your
program might print to output.
