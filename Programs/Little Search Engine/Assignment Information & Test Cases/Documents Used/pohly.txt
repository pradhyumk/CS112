No! But he was less positive. I gave him two hundred more and he
said grudgingly: All right. If I hear it. Say, what's in there that's
worth all that trouble?

Papers, I lied.

He leered. Sure.

No fooling, it's just personal stuff. Not worth a penny to anybody
but me, understand? So don't get any ideas.

He said in an injured tone: Mister, naturally the staff won't
bother your stuff. What kind of a hotel do you think this is?

Of course, of course, I said. But I knew he was lying, because I
knew what kind of hotel it was. The staff was there only because being
there gave them a chance to knock down more money than they could make
any other way. What other kind of hotel was there?
